# GOV.UK Component Guide

A living style guide and documentation for GOV.UK Components &mdash; A new approach to sharing UI patterns between applications without having to duplicate code.

## Caveats

It's still in it's early stages, many features are missing or incomplete, and documentation may not be 100% accurate. 

It currently depends on an unreleased version of [Slimmer](https://github.com/alphagov/slimmer), in particular on this [branch](https://github.com/alphagov/slimmer/pull/76/files), as well as a [branch](https://github.com/alphagov/static/pull/430/files) on [Static](https://github.com/alphagov/static).

If you're running those branches of Slimmer and Static locally then you can use this app by setting the `SLIMMER_DEV` environmental variable while running the app.

## Installation

It's a pretty standard Rails app, clone it, bundle and run with bundle.

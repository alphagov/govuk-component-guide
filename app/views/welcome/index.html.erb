<h1>GOV.UK Component Guide</h1>

<h2>What's a component?</h2>

<p>A simple way to share UI patterns between applications without having to duplicate code</p>

<h2>How does they work?</h2>

<p>Components hook in to your application template path and will allow you to insert a partial, which will handle it's own markup and styling.</p>

<p>You can can consider them an abstraction/blackbox around a piece of UI, where you don't want to care about how it works, just that it does.</p>

<h2>How do I use one?</h2>

<p>You need to be using <a href="https://github.com/alphagov/slimmer">Slimmer</a> in your Rails app, and add <code>include Slimmer::SharedTemplates</code> to your <code>ApplicationController</code>.</p>

<p>From a template call a partial scoped to <code>govuk_component/</code> followed by the component name (<a href="/component">available components</a>).</p>

<code class="block">
  &lt;%= render partial: 'govuk_component/example_component' %&gt;
</code>

<p>This is still a huge work in progress, but this guide is intended expose that work as early and widely as possible. Lots of feedback welcome to <a href="https://github.com/dsingleton/">David</a> and <a href="https://github.com/edds">Edd</a>.</p>

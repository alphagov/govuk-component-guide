  <h2>What's a component?</h2>

  <p>A simple way to share UI patterns between applications without having to duplicate code</p>

  <p>Components hook in to your application template path and will allow you to insert a partial, which will handle it's own markup and styling.</p>

  <p>You can can consider them an abstraction/blackbox around a piece of UI, where you don't want to care about how it works, just that it does.</p>

  <h2>How do I use one?</h2>

  <p>You need to be using <a href="https://github.com/alphagov/slimmer" rel="external">Slimmer</a> in your Rails app, and add <code>include Slimmer::GovukComponents</code> to your <code>ApplicationController</code>.</p>

  <div class="code-block">
    <code class="language-ruby">
class ApplicationController &lt; ActionController::Base
  include Slimmer::GovukComponents
end
    </code>
  </div>

  <p>From a template call a partial scoped to <code>govuk_component/</code> followed by the component name (<a href="<%= components_path %>">available components</a>).</p>

  <div class="code-block">
    <code class="language-ruby">&lt;%= render partial: 'govuk_component/example_component' %&gt;</code>
  </div>
</div>
